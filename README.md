The storyline of the project, as shown above, is that the main ship is being chansed through a battlefeild by a squad of enemy fighters, as they must escape in order to deliver information to the Rebels. Hoever parthway through this fight they are interrupted by a squad of Purrgil, a space faring entity that can travel through hyperspace to feed on gasses occuring on comets in space, this prvieds enough of a distraction for our pilot to escape.

This Project uses the following behviours;

  Pathfollowing
  Pursue + Flee
  Wander + Jitter Wander 
  Harmonic Wander
  Flocking
  Obsticle Avoidance
  Spine System
  
 Along with some other sundry code to help witht he runnig and creation of the project and assests
 
 The behaviours listed above were altered from work done in class, and for the ECS elements of the project (the rockts present in the scene) I worked off the Unity Examples for ECS as I was unable to use objects with multiple meshes for any of the code covered in class. The other sundry code such as spawner, reveal code, bundries and the camera control were written by me.
 
 The assests were collected from SketchFab and TurboSquid free assets stores.
 
 The assignment runs fully autonamously, with some exposed variale that can change the number of ships or entites being spawned to change the pverall business f the scene, there are also exposed variable should the user want to alter ship speeds or behaviours.
 
 There are no applied PostProcessing or trail Renderer techniques as the project is already graphically uintensive as I am not usng primitave objects similar to tose covered in class, and multiple meshes sow a system down and ar incompatible wotht he version of ECS we covered.
